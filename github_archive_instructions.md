# Archiving the SERP API Project on GitHub

This document provides step-by-step instructions for archiving the SERP API project on GitHub.

## Step 1: Prepare the Codebase

1. Make the preparation script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x prepare_for_archive.sh
   ```

2. Run the preparation script:
   ```bash
   ./prepare_for_archive.sh
   ```

3. This will create:
   - A directory called `serp-api-archive` with a clean, restructured codebase
   - A zip file called `serp-api-archive.zip` containing the same files

## Step 2: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account

2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"

3. Fill in the repository details:
   - Repository name: `serp-api` (or any name you prefer)
   - Description: "SERP API - An archived project for educational purposes only"
   - Visibility: Public
   - Initialize with a README: No (we'll use our own)
   - Add .gitignore: No (we've created our own)
   - Choose a license: No (we've included our own)

4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Upload the Codebase

### Option 1: Using Git Command Line

1. Navigate to the `serp-api-archive` directory:
   ```bash
   cd serp-api-archive
   ```

2. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. Add all files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit the files:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Archived project"
   ```

5. Add the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/serp-api.git
   ```

6. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Upload via GitHub Web Interface

1. On your new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"

2. Drag and drop the files from the `serp-api-archive` directory or click "choose your files" to select them

3. Add a commit message: "Initial commit - Archived project"

4. Click "Commit changes"

## Step 4: Archive the Repository

1. Go to your repository on GitHub

2. Click on "Settings" (tab with the gear icon)

3. Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section

4. Click on "Archive this repository"

5. Read the warning, then type the repository name to confirm

6. Click "I understand the consequences, archive this repository"

## Step 5: Add Archive Notice (Optional)

For extra clarity, you can add an archive notice to the repository description:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub

2. Click on "About" in the right sidebar

3. Click the gear icon to edit

4. Update the description to include "[ARCHIVED]" at the beginning

5. Click "Save changes"

## Final Result

Your archived repository will:

1. Have a clear README explaining why the project doesn't work properly
2. Include documentation about the limitations and challenges
3. Be marked as archived on GitHub (with a notice banner)
4. Be read-only (no new issues, pull requests, etc.)
5. Still be accessible for anyone who wants to study it for educational purposes

This approach ensures transparency about the project's limitations while still making the code available for educational purposes.
