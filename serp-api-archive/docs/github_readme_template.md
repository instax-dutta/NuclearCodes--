**IMPORTANT NOTICE: This project is archived and no longer maintained.**

This repository contains a simple API for searching Google and returning structured results. However, due to Google's anti-scraping measures, this approach is **not reliable for production use**.

## Why This Project Is Archived

This project was an experiment to create a simple search API by scraping Google results. However, it proved unreliable due to:

1. Google's anti-scraping measures
2. Frequent changes to Google's HTML structure
3. IP-based rate limiting and blocks
4. Inconsistent or empty results

**For reliable search APIs, please use official services like [Google Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search) or third-party services like [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/).**
