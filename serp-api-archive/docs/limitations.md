# SERP API Limitations

This document outlines the limitations of the SERP API project and explains why it was ultimately archived.

## Technical Limitations

### 1. Google's Anti-Scraping Measures

Google has sophisticated mechanisms to detect and block automated scraping:

- **HTML Structure Changes**: Google frequently changes their HTML structure, breaking parsers
- **Bot Detection**: Google uses various signals to detect automated requests
- **IP-based Rate Limiting**: Making too many requests from the same IP can trigger blocks
- **CAPTCHA Challenges**: Suspected bots are served CAPTCHA challenges

### 2. Parser Reliability Issues

The HTML parsing approach used in this project has several reliability issues:

- **Inconsistent Selectors**: CSS selectors that work today may not work tomorrow
- **Empty Results**: Many queries return empty result sets despite successful HTTP responses
- **Parsing Errors**: Changes in HTML structure can cause parsing errors

### 3. Legal and Terms of Service Considerations

Scraping Google search results may violate Google's Terms of Service, which explicitly prohibits:

- Sending automated queries without express permission
- Using software that sends automated queries to Google
- "Scraping" or creating automated methods to access Google services

## Alternatives

For those needing reliable search APIs, consider these alternatives:

### Official APIs

- [Google Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search)
- [Bing Web Search API](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-web-search-api)

### Third-Party Services

- [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/)
- [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com/)
- [Proxycrawl](https://proxycrawl.com/)

These services handle the complexities of scraping search engines and provide reliable, structured data.

## Conclusion

This project was an educational exercise to understand API development and the challenges of web scraping. It demonstrates why building reliable scraping tools for major search engines is difficult and why official APIs or specialized third-party services are typically better solutions for production environments.
